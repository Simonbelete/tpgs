\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Executive Summary}
The mobile app development proposal details the creation of ofline E-Learning mobile app and E-Library website for ILRI as a solution to making learning easy for farmers. The objective of the project is to make learning easy and interactive.

\subsection{Background}
Nowadays, the use of mobile devices, especially smartphones, continues to increase steadily. According to Statista,
the number of mobile device users has reached more than
five billion around the world, and will continue to grow in
the following years. Particularly, smartphone users reach 2.7
billion, which occupies around 52 percent of the mobile device
users

Google Android and Apple iOS are the two most popular
operating systems for smartphones currently available. Among
them, Android occupies 80 percent of the smartphone market.
Based upon StatCounter GlobalStats, Android is the most
popular operating system for mobile devices. Under this trend, we will be developing an Android mobile application.

In this paper, we propose an Android based farmers learning guide
and Website. Here users/farmers can read and watch videos of different course materials, any users can visit the website to download/view course materials download the mobile application and Admins can send Push notification to users messages

\subsection{Problem and Solution}
Due to the difficulty of learning and searching of a course materials from a pdf document, we propose a solution to build course materials(short videos, text and images) and interactive mobile application.


\section{Scope Of The Project}

\subsection{Objectives}
The objective of this project proposal is to define the project scope of E-Learning mobile app and E-Library and provide the Estimation.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Develop a mobile application fit for the client's needs within the set timeline and budget.
	\item Develop a website
	\item Develop multilingual mobile application and website
	\item Assist the client in the integration of the app in its operations.
	\item Orient the client on how the app is used
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scope}
\paragraph{Mobile Application Features:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Search for a course
	\item Play/view images and videos
	\item View Push Notifications
	\item Filter course by categories
	\item Select applications language
	\item Manage Push Notifications
	
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Website Features:}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Download the mobile application
	\item Link to play store download page
	\item Browse course materials in pdf
	\item Browse different course materials(i.e images, videos)
	\item Download course material files
\end{itemize}


\section{Project Estimation and Schedule}
\subsection{Cost Estimation}
A ballpark estimate is that it will take 30 days to design,
develop and test the mobile application and website. Here's a breakdown
of how much time each stage of the mobile app development
process will take:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{ | l | r | }
    \hline
    \textbf{Description} & \textbf{Cost (USD)} \\ 
    \hline
    Design and Development &  7,500 \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\setlength{\tabcolsep}{20pt}
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
\paragraph{Recurring Cost}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ |p{2cm}|p{7cm}|p{2cm}| } 
\hline
\textbf{Description} & \textbf{specification} & \textbf{Cost}  \\
\hline
Domain Renewal Charges & Domain names that ends with com(May vary depending on the domain name) & 12 to 50 USD/Year \\ 
\hline
Instance(VPS) & Regular Intel with SSD. CPU = 1 Cores, RAM 1GB  & 12 USD/Month \\
\hline
Storage & S3 Storage & 5 USD/Month \\
\hline
\textbf{Total} & - & \textbf{17 USD/Month} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsection{Schedule}
The project schedule is based on the project start date. Any change in start date would amount to changes in all subsequent delivery dates and additional fees. The actual project schedule and detailed planning inclusive of client reviews and feedback will be made based on inputs from client once requirements analysis is completed.

\begin{itemize}
	\item course material preparation: 10 Days
	\item Development + Beta Release: 18 Days
	\item User Acceptance Testing: 2 Days
	\item Total Duration 24 Days
\end{itemize}

\section{Ownership of the Project}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The Developer agrees that the Product is the sole property of the Client.
	\item The Developer hereby assigns the Client, without further compensation, all of its rights, titles and interests in and to the Product and any all related intellectual property rights in the Ethiopia and elsewhere.
	\item The Developer hereby agrees to keep and maintain adequate and current written records with respect to the Product (in the form of sketches, notes, drawings, videos and as may otherwise be specified by the Client) which records shall be available to the Client at all times and shall remain the sole property of the client at all times.
